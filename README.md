# Cjon256 Tap

This is for when whatmask is finally dropped from homebrew-core.

I make no claim to having authored either the software nor the whatmask file. Credit to those who did.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install cjon256/tap/whatmask`

Or `brew tap cjon256/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "cjon256/tap"
brew "whatmask"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
